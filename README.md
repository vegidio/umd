## üñºÔ∏è Usage

There are 2 ways to use this app: using the GUI or the CLI.

The GUI is the easiest way to use the app, with an intuitive interface that allows you to download media files with just a few clicks. The CLI is more advanced and allows you to download media files in a more automated way.

Both versions are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/vegidio/umd-app/releases) that matches your computer architecture and operating system and follow the instructions below:

### GUI

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/gui-screenshot.avif" width="80%" alt="UMD - GUI"/>
</p>

1. `Enter a URL` of the website where the media is hosted and then click on the `Query` button. If the URL belongs to a website supported by **UMD**, it will query the website and show the media files in the list below.
    - Mark the checkbox `Deep` if you want to perform a deep search. This will expand the search in the unknown URLs in an attempt to find more media files.
    - You can limit the number of files that will be queried by entering a number in the `Limit` field.
2. Select the media files that you want to download by clicking on the checkbox next to the file name, or click on the checkboxes to automatically select all images and/or videos.
3. Click on the button `Browse` to select the directory where you want the files to be saved and then click on the `Download` button to start the download.

### CLI

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/cli-screenshot.avif" width="80%" alt="UMD - CLI"/>
</p>

Run the command below in the terminal:

```bash
$ umd-dl -d ~/Downloads/UMD <url>
```

Where:

- `-d` (optional): the directory where you want the files to be saved; default is the current directory.
- `-l` (optional): the maximum number of files to download; default is 99.999 files.
- `<url>` (mandatory): the URL of the website where the media is hosted (**Attention:** it's important that the URL is the last parameter).

For the full list of parameters, type `umd-dl --help` in the terminal.

## üí° Features

### Cached results

When you query the same URL multiple times, the app caches the results to speed up the process, **as long as the files are saved in the same directory.**

You can adjust the app settings to bypass the cache and always fetch fresh results.

### Skip previously downloaded files

When downloading files to the same directory, the app will automatically skip files that have already been downloaded.

This feature helps to avoid duplicate downloads, ensuring only new or previously failed files are downloaded.

### Remove duplicates

This application will automatically delete all files that are identical.

## üí£ Troubleshooting

### "App Is Damaged..." (Unidentified Developer)

For a couple of years now, Apple has required developers to join their "Developer Program" to gain the pretentious status of an _identified developer_ üòõ.

Translating to non-BS language, this means that if you‚Äôre not registered with Apple (i.e., paying the fee), you can‚Äôt freely distribute macOS software. Apps from unidentified developers will display a message saying the app is damaged and can‚Äôt be opened.

To bypass this, open the Terminal and run the command below, replacing `<path-to-app>` with the correct path to where you‚Äôve installed the app:

```bash
$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <path-to-app>
```

### Download is taking too long

Some websites, like Coomer/Kemono, use techniques to block tools from scraping their content. **UMD**, however, includes countermeasures to bypass these restrictions. This process can make the downloads take longer than usual.

Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no way to speed up this process, so please be patient and allow the app to complete its work.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

### Dependencies

In order to build this project you will need the following dependencies installed in your computer:

- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)

If you want to build the GUI you will also need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Wails 2+](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation)

### Compiling

With all the dependencies installed, in the project's root folder run the command:

```bash
$ task <interface> os=<operating-system> arch=<architecture>
```

Where:

- `<interface>`: can be `cli` or `gui`.
- `<operating-system>`: can be `windows`, `darwin` (macOS), or `linux`.
- `<architecture>`: can be `amd64` or `arm64`.

For example, if I wanted to build a GUI version of the app for Windows, on architecture AMD64, I would run the command:

```bash
$ task gui os=windows arch=amd64
```

## üìà Telemetry

This app collects information about the data that you're downloading to help me track bugs and improve the general stability of the software.

**No identifiable information about you or your computer is tracked.** But if you still want to stop the telemetry, you can do that by adding the flag `--no-telemetry` in the CLI tool.

## üìù License

**UMD** is released under the MIT License. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.
