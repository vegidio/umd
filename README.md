## üñºÔ∏è Usage

There are 2 ways to use this app: using the GUI or the CLI.

The GUI is the easiest way to use the app, with an intuitive interface that allows you to download media files with just a few clicks. The CLI is more advanced and allows you to download media files in a more automated way.

Both versions are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Download the correct version that matches your computer architecture and operating system from the [latest release](https://github.com/vegidio/umd-app/releases) and follow the instructions below:

### GUI

<img src="assets/gui-screenshot.avif" width="80%" alt="UMD - GUI"/>
</p>

1. `Enter a URL` of the website where the media is hosted and then click on the `Query` button. If the URL belongs to a website supported by **UMD**, it will query the website and show the media files in the list below.
    - Mark the checkbox `Deep` if you want to perform a deep search. This will expand the search in the unknown URLs in an attempt to find more media files.
    - You can limit the number of files that will be queried by entering a number in the `Limit` field.
2. Select the media files that you want to download by clicking on the checkbox next to the file name, or click on the checkboxes to automatically select all images and/or videos.
3. Click on the button `Browse` to select the directory where you want the files to be saved and then click on the `Download` button to start the download.

### CLI

Download the [latest version](https://github.com/vegidio/umd-app/releases) of **UMD** that matches your computer architecture and operating system. Extract the .zip file somewhere and then run the command below in the terminal:

```
$ umd <url> -d /Downloads/UMD
```

Where:

-   `<url>` (mandatory): the URL of the website where the media is hosted.
-   `-d` (optional): the directory where you want the files to be saved; default is the current directory.
-   `--limit` (optional): the maximum number of files to download; default is no limit.

For the full list of parameters, type `umd --help` in the terminal.

### Docker

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) in your computer, then run the command below:

```
$ docker run --rm -t \
    -e UMD_URL=https://www.reddit.com/user/atomicbrunette18 \
    -v "/path/in/your/computer:/tmp/umd" \
    ghcr.io/vegidio/umd
```

Where:

-   `-e UMD_URL`: (mandatory): the URL of the website where the media is hosted.
-   `-e UMD_LIMIT` (optional): the maximum number of files to download; default is no limit.

#### Volume

For those that are not familiar with Docker, the `-v` (volume) parameter defines where the media will be saved, and it's divided in two parts, separated by the colon sign `:`. You just need to worry about the first part, on the left side of the colon sign (**don't change anything on the right side**) and update it according to a path in your computer where you want the media to be downloaded.

For example, if you want to download the media in the directory `/Downloads/UMD` then the volume parameter should look like this `-v "/Downloads/UMD:/tmp/umd"`.

## üí° Features

### Remove duplicates

This application will automatically delete all files that are identical.

### File filtering

You can filter the files that you want to download based on their extension, separated by comma. To do that you must:

-   **CLI tool:** add the parameter `--extensions`; for example: `--extensions jpg,jpeg`.

-   **Docker:** add the environment variable `-e UMD_EXTENSIONS`; for example: `-e UMD_EXTENSIONS=jpg,jpeg`.

### Convert images/videos (coming soon...)

You can convert the media downloaded to better formats (AVIF for images and AV1 for videos); this will make the files smaller but preserving the same quality. To do that you must:

-   **CLI tool:** add the parameters `--convert-images` and/or `--convert-videos`, depending on what you need.

-   **Docker:** add the environment variables `-e UMD_CONVERT_IMAGES=true` and/or `-e UMD_CONVERT_VIDEOS=true` when you run the container.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build

In the project's root folder run in the CLI:

Gradle:

```
$ ./gradlew assemble
```

Docker:

```
$ docker build -t ghcr.io/vegidio/umd . --build-arg="VERSION=24.5.0"
```

## üìà Telemetry

This app collects information about the data that you're downloading to help me track bugs and improve the general stability of the software.

**No identifiable information about you or your computer is tracked.** But if you still want to stop the telemetry, you can do that by adding the flag `--no-telemetry` in the CLI tool or the environment variable `-e UMD_TELEMETRY=false` when you run the Docker container.
